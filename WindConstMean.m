    % most of the following is taken from

    % According to the military references[1, 2], turbulence is a
    % stochastic process defined by velocity spectra. The turbulence
    % field is assumed to be visualized as frozen in time and space
    % (i.e.: time variations are statistically equivalent to distance
    % variations in traversing the turbulence field). This assumption
    % implies the turbulence-induced responses of the aircraft result
    % only from the motion of the aircraft relative to the turbulent
    % field
    % i.e. w = Omega * V
    % The turbulence axes orientation in this region is defined as being
    % aligned with the body coordinates.
