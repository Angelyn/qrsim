    % Turbulence model according to U.S. military specification MIL-F-8785C
    %
    % According to references[1, 2], turbulence can be modelled as a stochastic process 
    % defined by velocity spectra. The turbulence field is assumed to be visualized as 
    % frozen in time and space (i.e.: time variations are statistically equivalent to 
    % distance variations in traversing the turbulence field). This assumption implies 
    % that the turbulence-induced responses of the aircraft is result only of the motion
    % of the aircraft relative to the turbulent field
    % i.e. w = Omega * V
    % The turbulence axes orientation in this region is defined as being aligned with 
    % the body coordinates.
